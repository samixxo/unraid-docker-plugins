Paste the following url into the Install Plugins section:

```

##### Auto update docker images

A plugin designed to keep all (or selected) plugins / dockers up to date, with options for delayed upgrades.

Paste the following url into the Install Plugins section:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Squidly271/ca.update.applications/master/plugins/ca.update.applications.plg

Note that if you are utilizing CA's Appdata Backup / Restore module, then with this module installed you can also tell the Backup procedure to update the docker apps at the same time as the backup occurs
